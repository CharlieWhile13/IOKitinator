# IOKitinator
---
### A simple script to add IOKit to your Xcode/Theos iOS SDK

IOKitinator does not redistribute any Apple headers, it only copies them from the MacOS SDK and download from Apple Open Source.

**Requirements**: Xcode installed

To use this just type into Terminal `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharlieWhile13/IOKitinator/master/IOKitinator.sh)`
You will be prompted if you want to add to your Xcode SDK, and then your Theos SDK.

This has been tested on Xcode 11 and 12b4, I'm not responsible if something goes wrong, don't blame me if your computer catches fire or something. 

This tool is not affilitated with Apple in any way, all rights reserved.
